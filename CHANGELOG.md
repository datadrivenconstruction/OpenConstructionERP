## [1.4.4] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed — backend hardening cut

A focused stability + correctness pass driven by a multi-agent quality
audit of the v1.4.x backend.  No new user-visible features; the goal
is "everything that already exists works at scale and stays honest
about what version it is".

#### Memory hazard in vector auto-backfill
- ``backend/app/main.py::_auto_backfill_vector_collections`` used to
  ``SELECT *`` from each indexed table on startup, materialise the
  full result set into a Python list, and only THEN slice it down to
  ``vector_backfill_max_rows``.  On a 2M-row production deployment
  that allocated **gigabytes** of RAM at startup before the cap could
  even kick in.
- The new implementation issues a cheap ``SELECT COUNT(*)`` first to
  decide whether reindexing is needed, then pulls only the capped
  number of rows with ``LIMIT`` applied at the SQL level.  Memory
  usage is now bounded by ``vector_backfill_max_rows`` regardless of
  table size.
- Side benefit: the per-collection ``_load_X`` closures collapsed
  into a single declarative ``backfill_targets`` registry — 8 modules
  × ~12 LOC of copy-pasted loaders → one tuple per collection.  Total
  reduction in main.py: ~80 LOC.  This is also the foundation
  v1.4.5's full ``create_vector_routes()`` factory will build on.

#### Deprecated ``datetime.utcnow()`` removed (Python 3.14 readiness)
- ``datetime.utcnow()`` was deprecated in Python 3.12 and becomes a
  hard error in 3.14.  Replaced with ``datetime.now(UTC)`` across
  **8 call sites**: ``boq/router.py:2991``, ``documents/service.py:475``,
  ``tendering/router.py:378``, ``project_intelligence/collector.py:680``,
  ``punchlist/router.py:299``, ``meetings/router.py:984``,
  ``takeoff/router.py:1872``, plus ``bim_hub/router.py:869`` (which
  also got rewritten as part of the next bullet).
- The original quality audit only flagged 4 of these 8 sites; a
  follow-up grep across the whole backend caught the remaining 4.

#### Raw SQL → ORM in BIM upload cross-link
- ``bim_hub/router.py::upload_cad`` was using a hand-rolled
  ``INSERT INTO oe_documents_document`` via ``text()`` to create the
  Documents-hub cross-link entry.  The parameter binding was safe in
  practice but the pattern was fragile (any future schema change to
  ``Document`` would silently break the cross-link without test
  coverage), and it shipped a stray ``datetime.utcnow()``.
- Replaced with a clean ``Document(...)`` ORM insert that picks up
  every default + timestamp from the model and the ``Base`` mixin.
  The cross-link stays a best-effort try/except — it's convenience
  glue, not load-bearing on the main upload flow.

#### Functional ruff cleanup
- ``F401`` unused imports removed from ``boq/events.py``,
  ``project_intelligence/collector.py`` (``uuid``),
  ``project_intelligence/scorer.py`` (``Callable``),
  ``search/router.py`` (``Depends``).
- ``F541`` f-string without placeholders fixed in
  ``project_intelligence/advisor.py:399``.
- ``B905`` ``zip()`` without ``strict=`` fixed in
  ``costs/router.py:1742``.  This is the cost-database resource
  loader — without ``strict=True`` an array length drift would
  silently truncate component rows mid-import and corrupt the
  assembly composition with no audit trail.  ``strict=True`` raises
  immediately so the error is visible.
- Ruff style issues (``UP037``, ``UP041``, ``I001``) auto-fixed in
  ``costs/router.py``, ``project_intelligence/router.py`` /
  ``schemas.py``, ``documents/service.py``.

#### Version-sync CI guard (NEW)
- ``backend/pyproject.toml`` silently drifted from ``frontend/package.json``
  for **four minor versions** (v1.3.32 → v1.4.2 all shipped with
  the Python package stuck on ``1.3.31``, so ``/api/health`` lied
  about which version users were actually getting because
  ``Settings.app_version`` reads from ``importlib.metadata``).  v1.4.3
  retro-fixed the literal but left the door open for the same gap.
- New ``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` reads both files plus the top
  entries of ``CHANGELOG.md`` and ``frontend/src/features/about/Changelog.tsx``,
  and exits non-zero on any mismatch.  Wired into:
  - ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` as a local hook on the four version
    files (so a bump that touches only one file is rejected
    before it can be committed)
  - ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` as a dedicated ``version-sync`` job
    that runs in parallel with backend + frontend lanes
- Tested negatively (script catches drift) and positively (passes
  with all four files at ``1.4.4``).

### Verification
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.4
- Backend ``python -m uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory`` boots
  cleanly via ``app.router.lifespan_context`` smoke test:
  57 modules loaded, 217k vectors indexed, no startup errors
- ``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` passes at ``1.4.4`` after the
  bump (negative test confirmed it would fail at ``1.4.99``)

### Deferred to v1.4.5
- BIMPage.tsx i18n compliance (11+ hardcoded English strings flagged
  by frontend audit; needs sub-component ``useTranslation()``)
- ``create_vector_routes()`` factory + reduce ~250 LOC of duplicated
  ``vector/status`` and ``vector/reindex`` endpoints across 8 modules
- Trailing-slash audit of ``test_cross_module_flows.py`` and
  ``test_api_smoke.py`` (12 failing tests, all caused by missing
  trailing slashes — ``redirect_slashes=False`` is intentional,
  fixes a CORS 307 issue with the frontend)
- Deep-dive audit of recently-added modules (``requirements``,
  ``erp_chat``, ``project_intelligence``, ``bim_hub`` element groups,
  cross-module linking infrastructure) — looking for hacks,
  half-baked logic, missing cross-module wiring

## [1.4.3] — 2026-04-11

### Added — Requirements ↔ BIM cross-module integration

The Requirements module is now the **5th cross-module link type** on
BIM elements, mirroring the existing BOQ / Documents / Tasks /
Schedule activities pattern.  Requirements (EAC triplets — Entity,
Attribute, Constraint) are the bridge between client intent and the
executed model — pinning them to BIM elements lets estimators trace
*"this wall has fire-rating F90 because requirement REQ-042 says so"*
in one click.

#### Backend
- **New `oe_requirements` vector collection** (8th total).  Embeds the
  EAC triplet plus unit / category / priority / status / notes via
  the new ``RequirementVectorAdapter`` in
  ``backend/app/modules/requirements/vector_adapter.py``.  Multilingual
  by default — works across English / German / Russian / Lithuanian /
  French / Spanish / Italian / Polish / Portuguese.
- **Requirements service event publishing** — new ``_safe_publish``
  helper, plus standardised ``requirements.requirement.created /
  updated / deleted / linked_bim`` events on every CRUD and link
  operation.
- **`link_to_bim_elements()` service method** — additive by default
  (merges new ids with the existing array), pass ``replace=true`` to
  overwrite.  Stored under ``Requirement.metadata_["bim_element_ids"]``
  so no schema migration is needed.
- **`list_by_bim_element()` reverse query** — every requirement that
  pins a given BIM element id, scoped to a project for performance.
- **New router endpoints** in ``requirements/router.py``:
  - ``PATCH /requirements/{set_id}/requirements/{req_id}/bim-links/``
  - ``GET  /requirements/by-bim-element/?bim_element_id=&project_id=``
  - ``GET  /requirements/vector/status/``
  - ``POST /requirements/vector/reindex/``
  - ``GET  /requirements/{set_id}/requirements/{req_id}/similar/``
- **`RequirementBrief` schema** in ``bim_hub/schemas.py`` — mirrors
  the relevant subset of ``RequirementResponse`` to avoid a circular
  import.  Added to ``BIMElementResponse.linked_requirements``.
- **`BIMHubService.list_elements_with_links()` Step 6.5** — loads
  every requirement in the project once and filters in Python on the
  ``metadata_["bim_element_ids"]`` array, same cross-dialect pattern
  as the task and activity loops.  Return tuple now has 8 entries.

#### Frontend
- **New `BIMRequirementBrief` interface** + ``linked_requirements``
  field on ``BIMElementData``.
- **New `LinkRequirementToBIMModal`** — mirrors ``LinkActivityToBIMModal``
  exactly: loads every requirement set in the project, flattens
  requirements into a searchable list, click → PATCH the bim-links
  → invalidate the bim-elements query.  Color-coded by priority
  (must / should / may) and status (verified / conflict / open).
- **"Linked requirements" section in BIMViewer details panel** —
  violet themed, slots between "Schedule activities" and the
  semantic similarity panel.  Renders entity.attribute + constraint
  + priority badge + click-to-open.
- **BIMPage wiring** — new ``linkRequirementFor`` state +
  ``handleLinkRequirement`` / ``handleOpenRequirement`` handlers,
  modal mount, props passed to ``<BIMViewer>``.
- **RequirementsPage badge** — the expanded row now shows a
  "Pinned BIM elements" cell with the count read from
  ``metadata.bim_element_ids``.  Click navigates to ``/bim?element=...``
  with the first pinned element preselected.
- **RequirementsPage deep link** — parses ``?id=<requirement_id>``,
  fans out detail fetches across every set in the project to find
  the owning set, switches to it and expands the row.  Strips the
  param after one shot so refresh doesn't reapply.
- **GlobalSearchModal facet support** — fuchsia color for the new
  Requirements pill, ``oe_requirements`` mapped to ``/requirements?id=``
  in ``hitToHref``.
- **VectorStatusCard** picks up the new ``oe_requirements`` collection
  via the existing ``REINDEX_PATH`` table — admins can trigger a
  reindex from Settings.
- **Auto-backfill on startup** now indexes the requirements collection
  alongside the other 7 (capped by ``vector_backfill_max_rows``).

### Fixed (polish bundled into this cut)
- ``backend/pyproject.toml`` had silently drifted from the frontend
  version since v1.3.31 — every bump from v1.3.32 → v1.4.2 updated
  ``frontend/package.json`` but not the Python package.  ``/api/health``
  has therefore been reporting ``version: "1.3.31"`` across the entire
  v1.4.x series because ``app.config.Settings.app_version`` reads from
  ``importlib.metadata.version("openconstructionerp")``.  Bumped
  directly to ``1.4.3`` so the next deploy reports the real version.
- ``bim_hub/router.py`` CAD upload handler referenced ``cad_path`` and
  ``cad_dir`` variables that were never defined after the storage
  abstraction was introduced — the IFC/RVT processing branch crashed
  with ``NameError`` on every upload attempt (``ruff`` flagged the
  same issue as ``F821``).  Replaced the ghost variables with a
  ``tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`` workspace: the upload is materialised
  locally for the sync processor, any generated geometry is uploaded
  back through ``bim_file_storage.save_geometry`` before the tempdir
  is cleaned up, and the Documents hub cross-link now stores the real
  storage key returned by ``save_original_cad`` instead of the phantom
  ``cad_path``.
- ``SimilarItemsPanel`` no longer claims to support requirements —
  the generic panel only knows the item id, but the requirement
  similar endpoint is nested under the parent set
  (``/requirements/{set_id}/requirements/{req_id}/similar/``), so
  it needs both.  Requirement similarity is reachable only from the
  set-scoped detail page; the generic cross-module panel would have
  returned 404 for every call.  Removed the placeholder URL and the
  ``'requirements'`` entry from ``SimilarModuleKind``.

### Verification
- 718 total routes mounted across 57 loaded modules (real count from
  ``module_loader.load_all`` + ``fastapi.routing.APIRoute`` inspection)
- 8 vector collections, all with real adapters and reindex endpoints
- Frontend ``tsc --noEmit`` clean
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.3
- New tests: unit coverage for ``RequirementVectorAdapter``
  (``to_text`` / ``to_payload`` / ``project_id_of``) plus an integration
  test that drives ``PATCH /bim-links/`` → ``GET /by-bim-element/``
  → ``GET /models/{id}/elements/`` (Step 6.5) end-to-end

## [1.4.2] — 2026-04-11

### Security
- **SQL injection guard in LanceDB id-quoting** — every row id passed
  to ``_lancedb_index_generic``, ``_lancedb_delete_generic`` and the
  legacy ``_lancedb_index`` cost-collection upsert is now re-parsed as
  a strict ``uuid.UUID`` before being interpolated into the
  ``id IN (...)`` filter via the new ``_safe_quote_ids`` helper.
  Defence-in-depth — the adapter layer always passes UUIDs from
  SQLAlchemy ``GUID()`` columns, so a parse failure now indicates a
  bug or attack and the row is silently dropped.
- **Qdrant search payload mutation** — ``vector_search_collection``
  was using ``payload.pop()`` to extract reserved fields, which
  mutated the qdrant client's cached result objects.  Replaced with
  ``get()`` + a non-mutating dict comprehension.

### Fixed
- **Token-aware text clipping** — ``_safe_text`` now uses the active
  SentenceTransformer's tokenizer (when available) to clip at 510
  tokens instead of the previous 4000-character cap.  4000 chars
  routinely exceeded the 512-token cap of small SBERT models, causing
  silent in-model truncation that lost meaningful tail content.
  Falls back to the character cap when the tokenizer isn't available.
- **Frontend deep links now actually work** — `hitToHref` was
  generating route formats that no destination page parsed:
  - BOQ now uses ``/boq/<boqId>?highlight=<positionId>`` matching the
    real ``BOQEditorPage`` route + query.
  - DocumentsPage parses ``?id=<docId>`` and auto-opens the preview.
  - TasksPage parses ``?id=<taskId>``, scrolls the matching card into
    view, and adds a 2.5s ring highlight.
  - RiskRegisterPage parses ``?id=<riskId>`` and opens detail view.
  - BIMPage parses ``?element=<elementId>`` and selects the element
    once the elements list resolves.
  - Chat hits navigate to ``?session=<sessionId>`` from the new chat
    payload field.
  Each deep-link parser strips the query param after one shot so a
  refresh doesn't keep re-applying it.

### Added — BIM cross-module gap closure
- **`GET /api/v1/bim_hub/coverage-summary/?project_id=...`** — new
  aggregation endpoint returning ``{elements_total,
  elements_linked_to_boq, elements_costed, elements_validated,
  elements_with_documents, elements_with_tasks,
  elements_with_activities}`` plus matching percentages.  Each count is
  a single SELECT in the same async session — no N+1.  Documents,
  tasks, activities and validation are fetched defensively so a
  missing optional module doesn't 500 the call.
- **Dashboard `BIMCoverageCard`** — new widget rendering 6 progress
  bars + a headline percentage (avg of all 6 metrics).  Hides itself
  entirely on projects with zero BIM elements so non-BIM workflows
  stay clean.  Color-coded by completeness (green ≥75% / amber ≥40% /
  rose otherwise).
- **BOQ position BIM badge is now clickable** — the `OrdinalCellRenderer`
  blue pill that shows the linked BIM element count is no longer a
  read-only `<span>`; it's a `<button>` that navigates to
  ``/bim?element=<first_id>``.  Estimators can finally jump from a
  BOQ row to the 3D model element it was created from in one click.
- **Schedule activity BIM badge** — Gantt activity rows now render a
  small amber pill with the count of pinned BIM elements when
  ``activity.bim_element_ids`` is non-empty.  Click navigates to the
  BIM viewer with the first pinned element preselected.  Closes the
  4D-schedule reverse-nav gap.
- **BIM Quantity Rules page — Suggest from CWICR** — when a rule's
  target is "auto-create", the editor now exposes a "Default unit
  rate" field plus a one-click "Suggest from CWICR" button that calls
  ``/api/v1/costs/suggest-for-element/`` with the rule's filter
  context (element_type_filter, name, property_filter material) and
  prefills the top match.  The rate persists into
  ``boq_target.unit_rate`` and is read by the apply path
  (``_auto_create_position_for_rule``) so the new BOQ position lands
  fully priced — no second pass in the BOQ editor.

### Verification
- 766 total routes mounted (up from 765 in v1.4.1).  New routes:
  ``/api/v1/bim_hub/coverage-summary/``.
- Frontend ``tsc --noEmit`` clean.
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.2
  (4 pre-existing warnings in unrelated bim_hub/router.py CAD upload
  and BOQ-access-verifier code paths are not from this sweep).
- ``_safe_quote_ids`` smoke-tested against literal SQL injection
  payloads and confirms attacker strings are dropped.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Validation reports vector adapter** — `oe_validation` collection now
  has a real adapter (`backend/app/modules/validation/vector_adapter.py`),
  event subscribers wired to the new `validation.report.created/deleted`
  publishes, and `/api/v1/validation/vector/status/`,
  `/vector/reindex/`, `/{id}/similar/` endpoints.  Semantic search across
  validation history (e.g. "find reports about missing classification
  codes") now works.
- **Chat messages vector adapter** — `oe_chat` collection now has a real
  adapter (`backend/app/modules/erp_chat/vector_adapter.py`).  User and
  assistant messages with non-empty content are auto-indexed via the new
  `erp_chat.message.created` event publish in
  `service.py:_persist_messages`.  Long-term semantic memory for the
  AI advisor and per-message similarity search both now functional.
- **Auto-backfill on startup** — new `_auto_backfill_vector_collections`
  helper in `backend/app/main.py` runs as a detached background task
  during the lifespan startup.  For each of the 7 collections it
  compares the live row count to the indexed count and backfills any
  missing rows (capped by `vector_backfill_max_rows=5000` per pass to
  protect against multi-million-row tenants).  Disable with
  `vector_auto_backfill=False` in settings.  This closes the upgrade
  gap where existing v1.3.x BOQ / Document / Task / Risk / BIM / chat
  rows were unsearchable until the user manually called every per-module
  reindex endpoint.
- **Settings → Semantic Search Status panel** — new `VectorStatusCard`
  in `frontend/src/features/settings/`.  Renders a per-collection
  health table fetched from `/api/v1/search/status/` with one-click
  reindex buttons (POST to the matching `/vector/reindex/` route),
  engine + model + dimension + total-vectors badges, connection
  indicator and a "purge first" toggle for embedding-model migrations.

### Fixed
- The `bim_hub.element.updated` event subscription is now documented
  as a forward-compat hook (no current publisher — BIM elements are
  refreshed via the bulk-import path which already publishes
  `created`).  The day a `PATCH /elements/{id}/` endpoint lands, vector
  freshness will work without any wiring change.
- Backend `ruff check` clean across every file touched in this sweep
  (auto-fixed I001 import-order issues in two files).

### Verification
- Full app boot: 765 routes, 34 vector / similar / search routes (up
  from 28 in v1.4.0).  All 7 collections now have real adapters.
- `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` model loads from HuggingFace cache
  on first encode call — confirmed by Python boot.
- Frontend `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Cross-module semantic memory layer** — every business module now
  participates in a unified vector store via the new
  `app/core/vector_index.py` `EmbeddingAdapter` protocol.  Six new
  collections live alongside the existing CWICR cost index:
  `oe_boq_positions`, `oe_documents`, `oe_tasks`, `oe_risks`,
  `oe_bim_elements`, `oe_validation`, `oe_chat`.  All collections share
  the same schema (id / vector / text / tenant_id / project_id / module
  / payload) so the unified search layer can write to any of them
  through one code path.
- **Multilingual embedding model** — switched the default from
  `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (English-mostly) to `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`
  (50+ languages, same 384-dim).  CWICR's 9-language cost database now
  ranks correctly across English, German, Russian, Lithuanian, French,
  Spanish, Italian, Polish and Portuguese.  The legacy model is kept as
  a graceful fallback so existing LanceDB tables stay loadable.
- **Event-driven indexing** — every Position / Document / Task / Risk /
  BIM Element create/update/delete event now triggers an automatic
  upsert into the matching vector collection.  No cron jobs, no Celery
  workers, no manual reindex needed for normal operation.  Failures are
  logged and swallowed so vector indexing can never break a CRUD path.
- **Per-module reindex / status / similar endpoints** — every
  participating module now exposes:
  - `GET  /vector/status/` — collection health + row count
  - `POST /vector/reindex/?project_id=...&purge_first=false` — backfill
  - `GET  /{id}/similar/?limit=5&cross_project=true` — top-N most
    semantically similar rows, optionally cross-project
  Live: `/api/v1/boq/`, `/api/v1/documents/`, `/api/v1/tasks/`,
  `/api/v1/risk/`, `/api/v1/bim_hub/elements/`.
- **Unified cross-collection search API** — new `oe_search` module:
  - `GET /api/v1/search/?q=...&types=boq,documents,risks&project_id=...`
    fans out to every selected collection in parallel and merges the
    results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Cormack et al., 2009).
  - `GET /api/v1/search/status/` — aggregated per-collection health
  - `GET /api/v1/search/types/` — list of supported short names
- **Cmd+Shift+K Global Search modal** — frontend `GlobalSearchModal`
  with debounced input, facet pills (BOQ / Documents / Tasks / Risks /
  BIM / Validation / Chat) showing per-collection hit counts, current
  project scope toggle, grouped results and click-to-navigate routing.
  Works from any page including text fields so estimators can trigger
  semantic search while editing a BOQ row.
- **`<SimilarItemsPanel>` shared component** — universal "more like this"
  card that drops next to any record with `module="risks" id={...}`.
  Embedded in:
  - Risk Register detail view (cross-project lessons learned reuse)
  - BIM viewer element details panel
  - Documents preview modal (cross-project related drawings)
- **AI Chat semantic tools** — six new tool definitions for the ERP Chat
  agent: `search_boq_positions`, `search_documents`, `search_tasks`,
  `search_risks`, `search_bim_elements`, `search_anything`.  Each tool
  returns ranked hits with score + match reasons and the chat panel
  renders them as compact result cards.  System prompt updated to
  prefer semantic tools for free-text questions.
- **AI Advisor RAG injection** — `project_intelligence/advisor.py`
  `answer_question()` now retrieves the top-12 semantic hits from the
  unified search layer and injects them into the LLM prompt as a
  "Relevant context (semantic retrieval)" block.  The advisor is now a
  proper RAG agent — answers stay anchored in real evidence instead of
  hallucinating from the structured project state alone.

### Architecture
- New foundation file `backend/app/core/vector_index.py` — protocol,
  hit dataclass, RRF fusion, search/find_similar/index_one helpers.
- Multi-collection helpers in `backend/app/core/vector.py` —
  `vector_index_collection`, `vector_search_collection`,
  `vector_delete_collection`, `vector_count_collection` plus the
  `_lancedb_*_generic` and Qdrant equivalents.
- New `backend/app/modules/search/` module with manifest, schemas,
  service and router.
- Per-module `vector_adapter.py` files in `boq`, `documents`, `tasks`,
  `risk`, `bim_hub` — tiny stateless adapters implementing the
  `EmbeddingAdapter` protocol.

### Verification
- 759 total routes mounted; 28 vector / similar / search routes wired
  end-to-end.
- 217 487 CWICR cost vectors auto-loaded from existing LanceDB index on
  startup.
- Frontend `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Backend imports clean across foundation + 5 modules + unified search
  + 6 new chat tools + advisor RAG.
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion smoke-tested on synthetic rankings.

## [1.3.32] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **BIM viewer health stats banner** — top-of-viewport multi-pill banner
  shows total elements, BOQ-linked count, validation errors, warnings,
  has-tasks and has-documents counts.  Each pill is clickable and applies
  the matching smart filter to the viewport in one click.
- **Smart filter chips in BIMFilterPanel** — same five health buckets
  exposed as chips at the top of the filter sidebar (errors, warnings,
  unlinked-to-BOQ, has tasks, has documents).  Counts are computed from
  the cross-module link arrays on each element.
- **Color-by status modes** in the BIM viewer — three new colour-by
  options grouped under "By compliance":  🛡️ Validation status (red /
  amber / green), 💰 BOQ link coverage (red unlinked / green linked),
  📄 Document coverage.  Implemented via a new
  `ElementManager.colorByDirect()` helper that paints meshes from a
  fixed palette without rebuilding materials.
- **Cost auto-suggestion for BIM elements** — new
  `POST /api/v1/costs/suggest-for-element/` endpoint ranks CWICR cost
  items by classification overlap, element-type / material / family
  keyword matches and discipline tag overlap.  Each result carries a
  0..1 confidence score and human-readable match reasons.
- **Cost suggestion chips in AddToBOQModal** — the "Create new position"
  tab now fetches the top-5 ranked rates for the clicked element and
  renders them as one-click chips with code, description, unit rate and
  confidence dot.  Clicking a chip populates description / unit /
  unit_rate from the matching cost item — no manual lookup needed.

## [1.3.31] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Inline create-from-element modals** in BIM viewer — three new
  modals (`CreateTaskFromBIMModal`, `LinkDocumentToBIMModal`,
  `LinkActivityToBIMModal`) let the user create new tasks, link existing
  documents, and link existing schedule activities to a BIM element
  WITHOUT leaving the viewer.
- **Validation ↔ BIM per-element rules engine** — new
  `POST /api/v1/validation/check-bim-model` endpoint runs universal
  BIM rules (wall has thickness, structural has material, fire-rating
  present, MEP has system, etc.) against every element in a model.
  Per-element results eager-loaded into `BIMElementResponse.validation_results`
  + worst-severity rollup in `validation_status`.
- **Per-element validation badge** in the BIM viewer details panel,
  colour-coded by worst severity.
- **Tasks page** — `TaskCard` now renders a "Pinned to N BIM element(s)"
  badge with click-to-jump navigation.

### Fixed
- `ValidationReportResponse` pydantic schema collision with SQLAlchemy
  `MetaData()` class-level registry — switched to `validation_alias`.

## [1.3.30] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **BIM viewer cross-module deep integration** — element details panel now
  shows four collapsible link sections in one place: Linked BOQ Positions
  (existing), Linked Documents (drawings/RFIs/photos), Linked Tasks
  (defects/issues), Schedule Activities (4D timeline). Each section has
  count badges, clicking any row navigates to the target detail page.
- **Documents ↔ BIM** — new `oe_documents_bim_link` table + GET/POST/DELETE
  endpoints under `/api/v1/documents/bim-links/`. Bidirectional querying.
  Eager-loaded into `BIMElementResponse.linked_documents`.
- **Tasks ↔ BIM** — new `Task.bim_element_ids` JSON column. PATCH
  `/api/v1/tasks/{id}/bim-links` + reverse query. Eager-loaded into
  `BIMElementResponse.linked_tasks`.
- **Schedule ↔ BIM** — wired up the dormant `Activity.bim_element_ids` field
  with PATCH endpoint and `/api/v1/schedule/activities/by-bim-element/`
  reverse query. Eager-loaded into `BIMElementResponse.linked_activities`.
- **Documents preview modal** — new "Linked BIM elements" footer strip with
  click-to-navigate chips.

## [1.3.29] — 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Chat page** — removed the redundant "ERP AI Assistant" top bar. The
  app's main layout already provides a header; the chat-specific bar
  duplicated UI and didn't match the rest of the site palette. Clear
  chat now lives in the input bar.
- **Release process** — CHANGELOG.md now mirrors the in-app
  `Changelog.tsx` so the GitHub release workflow can extract the right
  section when a tag is pushed (the workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  reads `## [VERSION]` patterns from this file).

## [1.3.28] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Universal Building / Other split** in BIM filter — every category
  is classified by its semantic bucket and rendered in either a
  "real building elements" section (chips at top) or a collapsible
  "Annotations & analytical" section (closed by default). Works
  zero-curation for any project.
- **Pretty category names** for ~150 well-known Revit categories
  ("Curtainwallmullions" → "Curtain Wall Mullions", "Doortags" → "Door Tags").
  Anything not in the table passes through with first-letter
  capitalised — no wrong algorithmic word splits.

### Fixed
- BIM filter "None" element_type (the 6 048 Revit-ingest junk rows in
  the demo) now classified as noise.
- Headless test verdict baseline comparison.

## [1.3.27] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **3 grouping modes** in BIM filter via segmented control:
  **By Category** (flat, default), **By Type Name** (Revit Browser
  hierarchy), **Buckets** (semantic).

## [1.3.26] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **"Add to BOQ" 500** — the v1.3.22 backend agent's ownership check
  referenced `position.project_id` but Position has no such column;
  the project lives on the parent BOQ via `position.boq_id`. Fix:
  rewrote `_verify_boq_position_access` as a single-row SELECT joining
  Position → BOQ.

## [1.3.25] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Saved Groups panel section** in BIMFilterPanel — collapsible,
  one-click apply, hover-revealed link/delete actions.
- Headless test full saved-group lifecycle (save → list → apply → delete).

## [1.3.24] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Pluggable storage backend** (`app/core/storage.py`) with
  `LocalStorageBackend` (default) and `S3StorageBackend` (opt-in via
  `pip install openconstructionerp[s3]`). Supports MinIO / AWS / Backblaze /
  DigitalOcean Spaces.
- **BIM Element Groups** — new `oe_bim_element_group` table for saved
  selections. Dynamic groups recompute members from a filter; static
  groups freeze the snapshot.
- **SaveGroupModal** for saving the current filter as a named group.
- **Architecture doc** — `docs/BIM-STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md` with the
  three-layer design + migration path.

## [1.3.23] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- Headless deep test (`frontend/debug-bim.cjs`) extended with 4 new
  test groups verifying every UI surface from v1.3.22.
- `ElementManager.batchMeshesByMaterial()` — three.js BatchedMesh
  collapse for big-model perf (gated at 50 000+ meshes pending GPU
  visibility-sync work).

### Fixed
- Sidebar `nav.bim_rules` translation key.

## [1.3.22] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **BIM ↔ BOQ linking** end-to-end. Backend embeds `boq_links` in
  element response; `apply_quantity_maps` actually persists; `Position.cad_element_ids`
  auto-syncs on link CRUD.
- **Add to BOQ modal** — Link to existing position OR create new with
  pre-filled quantities, single-element and bulk modes.
- **Quick takeoff** button in filter panel — bulk-link visible elements.
- **BIM Quantity Rules page** at `/bim/rules` — dedicated UI for rule-based
  bulk linking.
- **Selection sync store** — BOQ row click highlights linked BIM
  elements orange and vice versa.
- **Toolbar rework** — removed broken 4D/5D stubs, added camera
  presets (Fit / Iso / Top / Front / Side), grid toggle.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **CDE Link Document modal** — searchable document picker instead of redirect to /documents page
- **20-language translations** for User Management module

### Fixed
- **All form field mismatches** — systematic audit and fix of 15+ modules (Tasks, Meetings, RFI, NCR, Submittals, Inspections, Correspondence, Contacts, Transmittals, Finance, Safety, Procurement)
- **Trailing slash CORS issue** — all GET list endpoints now use trailing slash to prevent 307 redirect → CORS block
- **Contacts display** — field names aligned with backend (`first_name`/`last_name`, `primary_email`, `country_code`)
- **Procurement PO list** — fixed endpoint URL (`/purchase-orders` → `/`) and paginated response handling

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Professional BOQ features
- **Custom Columns** with 7 one-click presets — Procurement (Supplier, Lead Time, PO Number, PO Status), Notes, Quality Control (QC Status, Inspector, Date), Sustainability (CO₂, EPD, Material Source), **German Tender Style** (KG-Bezug, Lohn-EP, Material-EP, Geräte-EP, Sonstiges-EP, Wagnis %), **Austrian Tender Style** (LV-Position, Stichwort, Lohn-Anteil %, Aufschlag %, Lieferant), **BIM Integration** (IFC GUID, Element ID, Storey, Phase). Manual form for everything else. Live fill-rate progress bar shows how complete each column is.
- **Renumber positions** with gap-of-10 scheme (`01`, `01.10`, `01.20`, `02`, `02.10`) — matches the professional German/Austrian tender output convention. Lets you insert `01.15` later without renumbering everything else. New `POST /boqs/{id}/renumber` endpoint + toolbar button.
- **Excel round-trip with custom columns** — supplier, notes and procurement values are now exported to .xlsx and survive a full import → edit → export cycle. Number-typed columns are formatted as numbers in the spreadsheet.
- **Project Health bar** on Project Detail — circular progress with 5 checkpoints (BOQ created → positions added → all priced → validation run → no errors) and a single "Next step" button that always points at the first incomplete item.

### Added — Security hardening (from QA / pentest report)
- **Strong password policy** — 8+ chars, ≥1 letter, ≥1 digit, blacklist of 24 common/leaked passwords. `password`, `12345678` and friends are now rejected with a clear 422.
- **Login rate limit** — 10 attempts per minute per IP, returns 429 with `Retry-After` header.
- **JWT freshness check** — old tokens are invalidated automatically when the user changes password (via `password_changed_at` column + `iat` comparison in `get_current_user_payload`).
- **Security headers middleware** — `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy` (relaxed for SPA, excluded from /docs and /redoc), `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS only).
- **Schedule date validation** — `start_date > end_date` is now rejected with a clear 422 (Pydantic `model_validator`).
- **PDF upload magic-byte check** — `/takeoff/documents/upload` now rejects JPGs/HTML/etc. renamed to `.pdf`.
- **Cross-user permission boundary verified** — User B gets 403 on every attempt to read/modify/delete User A's data (end-to-end test in place).

### Added — UX & frontend
- **User-friendly API error messages** — `ApiError` now extracts the actual FastAPI `detail` string instead of `"API 500: Internal Server Error"`. Covers FastAPI 422 validation arrays, generic envelopes, and per-status fallbacks (400/401/403/404/409/413/422/429/500/502/503/504). Network errors and `AbortError` get their own friendly text. 14 i18n keys × 21 locales added.
- **Modernized update notification** in the sidebar — gradient emerald/teal/cyan card with pulsing Sparkles icon, grouped highlights (New / Fixed / Polished), in-app changelog link (scrolls to `/about#changelog`), GitHub release link, change-count badge. Caches the GitHub response in `localStorage` (1h TTL) so multi-tab sessions don't burn the unauthenticated rate limit.
- **Continue your work** card on Dashboard — gradient card showing the most recently updated BOQ with name, project, position count and grand total; one click jumps back to the editor.
- **Role-aware ChangeOrders Approve button** — hidden for non-admin/manager roles; an "Awaiting approval" amber badge appears instead, so users no longer click into a 403.
- **Highlight unpriced positions** in the BOQ grid — subtle amber background and 3px left border on rows where `qty > 0` but `unit_rate = 0`.
- **Duplicate-name guard** for new projects — typing a name that matches an existing project shows an amber warning and requires a second click to confirm.
- **Single source-of-truth** for app version — `package.json` is the only place to edit. Sidebar, About page, error logger, update checker and bug-report params all import `APP_VERSION` from a Vite-injected define.
- **Changelog** entries filled in for v0.5.0, v0.6.0, v0.7.0 (previously the in-app history jumped from v0.4 → v0.7 with no notes).
- **Accessibility** — `<h1>` (sr-only) on /login and /register, `name` and `id` attributes on all auth inputs, `aria-label` on password show/hide buttons, dead `_SavedSessionsList` removed.
- **Keyboard shortcuts dialog** — removed misleading shortcuts that browsers reserved (`Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+Shift+N`); fixed buggy "Ctrl then Shift then V" separator; added `g r` → Reports and `g t` → Tendering navigation sequences.

### Fixed — backend critical bugs
- **`ChangeOrders POST /items` returned 500 for every payload** — `MissingGreenlet` on `order.code` after `_recalculate_cost_impact` (which calls `expire_all`) triggered a lazy load in async context. Fix: capture identifying fields before the recalc, then `refresh(item)` after.
- **`5D /generate-budget` returned 500 on missing `boq_id`** — bare `uuid.UUID(str(...))` raised on empty body. Fix: validate explicitly with try/except → 422 on bad input. Auto-pick the most recently updated BOQ when omitted.
- **Project soft-delete was leaky** — `DELETE /projects/{id}` set `status=archived`, but the project still came back from `GET`, list, and BOQ list. Fix: `get_project` gains `include_archived` flag (default `False`); `list_projects` defaults to `exclude_archived=True`; BOQ verify treats archived as 404.
- **Requirements module tables were missing on fresh installs** — module models were not imported in `main.py`/`alembic env.py`, so `Base.metadata.create_all()` skipped them. Fix: added the missing imports; same for 6 other previously missing module models.
- **Custom Columns SQLAlchemy JSON persistence** — only the FIRST added column was being saved due to in-place dict mutation. Fix: build a fresh `dict` and call `flag_modified(boq, "metadata_")` to defeat value-based change detection.
- **Custom column edit silently rewrote `total`/`unit_rate`** — `update_position` re-derived pricing from `metadata.resources` on every metadata patch. Fix: only re-derive when `quantity` actually changed OR the resources list itself differs from what's stored. Critical correctness fix for resource-priced positions.

### Changed
- The visible "Quick Start Estimate" flow now uses **gap-of-10 ordinals** by default — new positions get `01.40`, `01.50` etc. instead of `01.4`, `01.5`.
- `update_position` is stricter about when it touches pricing fields — only quantity/rate/resource changes recalculate `total`. Pure metadata patches leave the existing total intact.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: pip install -e ./backend** — `[project.urls]` was placed before `dependencies` in pyproject.toml, breaking editable installs and PyPI builds
- **CRITICAL: BOQ Duplication crash** — MissingGreenlet error when duplicating BOQ (eagerly capture ORM attributes before session expiry)
