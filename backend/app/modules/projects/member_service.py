"""Project-member service.

The Team Strip surfaces "who is on this project" at the project level. We
implement it as a thin wrapper over the existing team-membership tables -
each project gets a "Default Team" on creation (see
``ProjectService.create_project``), so project-membership = membership in that
default team. If for some reason no default team exists yet (legacy projects
created before that auto-create logic shipped) we lazily create one on the
first add.

Why not introduce a brand-new ``oe_projects_member`` table?
    * Avoids a duplicate join-table + migration for what is conceptually the
      same thing.
    * Existing visibility rules (entity → team mapping) already key off
      ``team_id``, so reusing the default team keeps visibility consistent.
    * The Team module already has ``add_member`` / ``remove_member`` /
      ``list_members`` plumbing we can delegate to.
